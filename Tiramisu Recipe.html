    <h1>Tiramisu Recipe</h1>
    <h3>By Ayaan</h3>
    <p>Done correctly, a classic tiramisù can be transcendent. <br> A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened <br> whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, tiramisù relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. <br> If you don’t have a barista setup at home, pick up the espresso at a local coffee shop, or use strongly <br> brewed coffee. As for the ladyfingers, make your own or buy them, but keep in mind that store-bought <br> varieties can range from soft and spongy (like angel food cake) to hard and crunchy (like biscotti). <br> Both kinds will work here, but if you're using the softer variety, stick to a light brushing of espresso, <br> instead of a deep dip.</p>
    
    <h3>What You Will Need:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Ingredients:</b></li>
    <ul>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)</li>
            <li>1¾ cups good espresso or very strong coffee</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)</li>
            <li>1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)</li></ul>
  

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar <br> until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) <br> when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft-medium <br> peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the <br> mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
        <li>Make the espresso in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan <br> would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous <br> and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. <br> Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in <br> any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. <br> Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</li>
        <li>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all <br> the better) before slicing or scooping to serve.</li>
